		<h1> Mariella's Bio </h1>

		<p> I create systems and ideas that center on helping people interact better with the world around them. I launched a major project personal to my life called Project Hearing last month that focuses on creating an aggregated database of websites and apps for deaf and hard of hearing people to navigate a hearing world that is not always accommodating to them using webflow, a design tool that allows me to quickly prototype and launch a complicated webpage, with a database connected!
		<br>
		I have worked for the Department of Defense as a Jr Financial Analyst (during government shutdowns and financial freezes which resulted in some of the nastiest (and most fun) Excel sheets I have ever worked on in my life!) and for tech teams like the Georgetown University IT Department where I acted as a Middleware Developer—which is another way of saying “a software developer that can speak human English and translate between developer-talk and user-needs.”
		<br>
		Also had the honor of working at Code for Progress (CfP) as Operations and Community Organizer. CfP is a non-profit organization that seeks to diversify the tech industry by providing a paid year-long software engineering training program for members of underrepresented communities. I did the program for its inaugural class and was hired Full-Time for the second year of the program!</p>
